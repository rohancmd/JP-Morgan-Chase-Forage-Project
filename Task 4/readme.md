# Task 4 – Probability of Default (PD) Mapping

The final task used the quantized FICO scores to build a **rating map** that links borrower credit ratings with observed probabilities of default.

### Key Objectives
- Combined results from the FICO quantization (Task 3).
- Produced a **FICO → Rating** mapping table.
- Compared results using both **Log-Likelihood** and **MSE** optimization methods.

### Files
- `fico_bucketing_model.py` – rating map generator.
- `FICO_Bucket_Mappings.csv` – final output file with PD and rating mappings.

**Outcome:**  
Created a structured FICO rating system to guide credit risk modeling and classification.
