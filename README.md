# JP Morgan Chase Forage Virtual Experience Program

This repository contains all four tasks completed as part of the **JP Morgan Chase & Co. – Data Analytics & Risk Virtual Internship (Forage)**.  
The project simulates real-world scenarios in **credit risk analysis**, **portfolio management**, and **default prediction modeling**.

---

## Overview
The internship focused on analyzing financial data to estimate portfolio losses, assess credit risk, and predict the probability of default (PD) using borrower FICO scores.  
Each task builds upon the previous one, forming a complete workflow from raw data analysis to model implementation.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1 – Portfolio and Risk Analysis
- Analyzed loan portfolio to estimate **Exposure at Default (EAD)**, **Loss Given Default (LGD)**, and **Expected Loss (EL)**.
- Built the foundation for understanding portfolio-level credit exposure.

### Task 2 – Personal Loan Default Prediction
- Developed a **machine learning model** to predict loan defaults.
- Conducted feature analysis and model performance evaluation.

### Task 3 – Mortgage Portfolio (FICO Quantization)
- Implemented **quantization** using **dynamic programming** to convert continuous FICO scores into categorical risk ratings.
- Optimized bucket boundaries using **MSE** and **Log-Likelihood** methods.
- Presented results in a professional slide deck.

### Task 4 – Probability of Default (PD) Mapping
- Created a **FICO → Rating** mapping table showing PD for each category.
- Compared outputs from both optimization methods and generated final mappings.
