# Task 2 – Personal Loan Default Prediction

This task involved building a simple machine learning model to predict loan default risk for individual borrowers.

### Key Objectives
- Preprocessed personal loan data for model readiness.
- Analyzed key variables influencing default behavior.
- Built a predictive model using Python and evaluated performance metrics.

### Files
- `task2_model.py` – machine learning model script.
- `Task2_Data.csv` – dataset.

**Outcome:**  
Predicted default probabilities and identified top factors contributing to borrower risk.
